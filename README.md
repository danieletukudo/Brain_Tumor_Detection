# Brain Tumor Detection Web Application and Training Pipeline

This project includes a Flask-based web application for detecting brain tumors using a pre-trained TensorFlow Lite model and a training pipeline for training the model using MRI scan images.

## Web Application

The web application allows users to upload MRI scans of their brains, and the application predicts whether a tumor is present or not.

### Features

- Upload MRI scans of brain images.
- Predict whether a brain tumor is present or not.
- Display prediction results to the user.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/danieletukudo/Brain_Tumor_Detection.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Download the pre-trained TensorFlow Lite model and place it in the project directory.

### Usage

1. Run the Flask application:

    ```
    python app.py
    ```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:7017`.
3. Upload an MRI scan image of a brain.
4. Click the "Upload" button to make the detection.
5. Wait for the prediction result to be displayed.

## Model and Training Pipeline

The training pipeline includes data augmentation, model training, and quantization steps.

### Model

The model is implemented using the VGG16 architecture, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. It consists of convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers. The model outputs probabilities for two classes: "No Brain Tumor Detected" and "Brain Tumor Detected".

### Training Pipeline

1. Data Augmentation: Data augmentation is performed using the `ImageDataGenerator` class from TensorFlow. It includes random transformations such as rotation, horizontal and vertical flips, shear, and shift.

2. Model Training: The model is trained using the augmented data generated by the `ImageDataGenerator`. Training is performed using the `fit` method of the model, with specified number of epochs and batch size.

3. Model Quantization: After training, the model can be quantized to reduce its size while preserving accuracy. Quantization is performed using TensorFlow Lite, which converts the model to a quantized TensorFlow Lite format.

### Usage

To train the model and perform quantization, execute the `training` class:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    trained_model_name = "1model.h5"
    train = training()
    training = False  # Set to True to perform training

    if training:
        train.training(epochs=100, train_path="dataset/train",
                       val_path="dataset/val",
                       input_shape=(100, 100, 3),
                       trained_model_name="trained_model_name")

    train.quantize_model(trained_model_name)
```
